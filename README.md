# My Wallpaper Manager

This is a Spring Boot application with Kotlin, that exposes HTTP REST endpoints for Task/Routine (that I plan to wrap up throughout the day) and makes wallpapers out of that task and apply on my Windows 10 machine. Such wallpaper, suggests what to focus on at that time.

Thanks to [Fake Images Please?](https://fakeimg.pl/ "Fake Images Please?") for offering there easy to use image generator with HTTP client, which allowed not focus on image editing much (formatting the text in centre took some work).

Also, thatnks to [Humberto Pinheiro](https://github.com/humbhenri/wallpaperMonster "Humberto Pinheiro") for sharing his Java Native API code that helped to apply the images as wallpaper on Windows 10.
